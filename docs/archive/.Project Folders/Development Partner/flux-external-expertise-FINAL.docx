Flux 2.0: External Development Scope

*Two-Sided Habit Reward Platform with Real Money*

Core Innovation: Two-Sided Earning System

Flux is the first platform where users earn real money for BOTH doing
positive things AND avoiding negative things. Every successful action
transfers real money from checking to savings.

**BUILD Habits - Earn for doing positive things:**

-   Workout 30 min → Earn \$1.50 (checking → Flux savings)

-   Read 20 pages → Earn \$1.00

-   Meal prep → Earn \$3.00

**RESIST Habits - Earn for NOT doing negative things:**

-   Each day without DoorDash → Earn \$35 (checking → Flux savings)

-   Each day without gambling → Earn \$50

-   Each day without nail biting → Earn \$2

**Key:** Users only earn when they succeed---never lose money.
Motivation comes from opportunity cost: \"If I order DoorDash, I miss
out on earning \$35 today.\"

How RESIST Habits Work (Critical Feature)

**Daily Detection & Transfer:**

-   Automated: Bank account reading detects DoorDash, gambling, shopping
    apps

-   Manual: User confirms behaviors like nail biting, snacking,
    doomscrolling

-   Each scheduled day resisted = money transfer

-   Each scheduled day failed = no transfer (missed opportunity, not
    penalty)

**Example week:** 5 days no DoorDash (\$35 × 5 = \$175) + 3 workouts
(\$1.50 × 3 = \$4.50) + 7 days no nail biting (\$2 × 7 = \$14) =
**\$193.50 transferred Friday**

In-House Development (Frontend)

-   React application with mobile-first design

-   Portfolio dashboard with investment aesthetic

-   BUILD and RESIST habit creation and logging UI

-   Onboarding, settings, activity feed, behavioral indices UI

Required External Expertise

Tier 1: Critical Infrastructure (Must Outsource)

**Banking Infrastructure** --- \$15-25K

-   Plaid integration for bank account connections

-   Daily transaction reading for RESIST habit detection (DoorDash,
    gambling, etc.)

-   Stripe Connect for automated transfers (checking → Flux savings)

-   PCI compliance and financial security standards

**Backend & Database** --- \$8-12K

-   Supabase architecture with PostgreSQL

-   User authentication (email/Google/Apple)

-   Daily RESIST habit success detection logic

-   RESTful API and real-time sync

Tier 2: Core Features (Strongly Recommended)

**Behavioral Indices & HHS Calculations** --- \$10-15K

-   Habit Health Score (HHS) algorithm

-   Category aggregation for anonymized data

-   Percentile rankings and gaming prevention

**Smart Notifications** --- \$5-8K

-   Firebase/OneSignal infrastructure

-   ML-optimized timing and churn prevention

  Banking Infrastructure  \$15-25K          **Critical**

  Backend & Database      \$8-12K           **Critical**

  Indices & HHS Logic     \$10-15K          **High**

  Smart Notifications     \$5-8K            **High**
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Critical Phase 1 Total:** \$23-37K (Banking + Backend + Indices)

Why This Matters

-   **Only app rewarding BOTH positive actions AND avoided negative
    actions**

-   Pure positive reinforcement---users never lose money, only earn

-   Daily RESIST habit detection creates continuous engagement

-   Real money transfers from day one---not a future feature

-   Behavioral indices create competitive advantage and data moat
