# FLUX - PROJECT MISSION & VISION

**Tagline:** *Invest in yourself, literally.*

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Flux is a behavior change platform that rewards users with real money for positive decisions and building good habits. In a world designed to extract your money and attention, Flux helps you build wealth by becoming better.

**What it is:** A behavior change tool with financial rewards  
**What it isn't:** A fintech app with habit features bolted on

---

## THE PROBLEM

**The Modern Attention & Spending Economy:**
- Predatory apps (DoorDash, FanDuel, impulse spending platforms) are engineered to manipulate behavior
- These platforms are designed to extract maximum money and attention from users
- Traditional habit trackers use fake points and gamification that don't create lasting change
- Budgeting apps create guilt and restriction without addressing root behaviors
- People want to improve but lack tangible incentives for making hard choices

**The Gap:**
People need a tool that:
- Provides real incentives for positive behavior
- Protects them against exploitative platforms
- Creates tangible progress they can see and feel
- Helps them become better while building actual wealth

---

## THE SOLUTION

Flux creates a simple, powerful cycle:

1. **You make a positive decision**
   - Resist DoorDash â†’ Earn $35
   - Morning workout â†’ Earn $5
   - Skip Starbucks â†’ Earn $8
   - Cook at home instead of ordering â†’ Earn $15

2. **Real money accumulates in your in-app savings account**
   - Watch your balance grow as you build better habits
   - Acorns-style experience
   - Your progress has real financial value

3. **Transfer or invest your earnings**
   - Withdraw to your linked bank account
   - **Future:** Route directly to Coinbase, investment accounts, or charities
   - **Future:** Automate transfers per habit or category

4. **Become your own best investment**
   - You're not "saving money you would have spent"
   - You're **paying yourself** for doing hard things
   - You become your own investor - investing in your future self

## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### The Psychology
- **Real money creates real motivation** - Loss aversion + tangible progress
- **Positive reinforcement** - Celebrate wins, not punish failures
- **Non-judgmental awareness** - No guilt or shame, just honest tracking
- **User stays in control** - Confirmation required, not automated assumptions

### The Mission
Help people make better choices in a world designed to make them fail.

### The Positioning
**Against:** Apps that extract your money and attention  
**For:** Your future self, your health, your wealth

### Key Principles
1. Behavior change first, finance second
2. Real money rewards, not fake points
3. Assistance and reminders, not automation without consent
4. Non-judgmental, supportive tone
5. User confirms every action - it's an accountability partner, not an autonomous agent

## HOW IT WORKS

### Current State (POC)
**Manual Habit Tracking:**
- User creates "Building" habits (things to do) and "Breaking" habits (things to resist)
- Variable rate system: flat amounts, per-minute, per-calorie, per-unit
- Log completions, resistances, skips, or failures
- Virtual balance tracking
- Visual progress with charts and streaks

### Near-Term Vision (Phases 2-5)
**Smart Accountability Partnership:**

**Phase 2-3: Backend + Bank Integration**
- User accounts with cloud sync
- Plaid integration for bank transaction monitoring
- Pattern learning: "You usually order DoorDash 3x/week on Tue/Thu/Sat evenings"
- Historical spending analysis

**Phase 4: Smart Check-Ins**
- Contextual prompts at key moments
- "It's Thursday 7pm - your usual DoorDash time. Resisted today?"
- Real-time transaction alerts: "$35 DoorDash detected - log this spend?"
- Weekly recap: "You resisted DoorDash 4x this week - log these?"
- Non-judgmental framing for spending detection

**Phase 5: Health Device Integration**
- Oura Ring, Whoop, Apple Health, Fitbit
- Auto-detect workouts when heart rate data shows exercise
- Auto-track sleep when sleep score meets threshold
- Push notifications when habits auto-detected
- Manual override for incorrect detections

**Phase 6: Real Money Movement**
- Stripe integration for in-app savings account
- Plaid for bank linking and transfers
- Automated weekly/monthly transfers
- Balance holds until user decides to withdraw
- Compliance with financial regulations

  - "Supportive Friend" - Warm, empathetic, understanding
  - "Financial Advisor" - Data-driven, ROI-focused, analytical
  - "Wellness Guide" - Health-first, holistic, gentle

**External Routing Destinations**

### Business Risks

- **Competition from big banks:** Move fast, build strong community
- **Trust (handling money):** Transparency, clear ToS, secure infrastructure
